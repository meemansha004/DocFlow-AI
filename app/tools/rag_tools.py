"""
Tools for the RAG Agent — thin @tool wrappers over the retrieval pipeline
(app/services/rag/retrieval.retrieve), the direct generation/summarisation
calls (app/services/rag/generation), the ABAC document check
(app/services/access_control), and the confidential-access request service
(app/services/access_requests_service).

WHO is asking and WHICH project is NOT a tool argument — it comes from
app/services/rag_context (set per-turn by run_rag_turn), so a chat message
can never make a tool act as another user or in another project. The only
things the LLM supplies are the query text, an optional stage name, a
document reference, and a team reference — never an identity, never a
document_id, never a raw access decision.

Each tool returns a dict with a "status" field. The agent relays these
verbatim in spirit — it must not invent an answer, a summary, a citation, or
a confirmation that a tool did not return.
