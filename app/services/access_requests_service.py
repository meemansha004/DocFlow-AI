"""
Confidential-access request workflow — the service logic, shared by every
entry point that can create one:

  * POST /access-requests           (app/routers/access_requests.py) — the
    direct UI action / button.
  * request_confidential_access tool (app/tools/rag_tools.py) — the RAG Agent
    offering to request access on the user's behalf after retrieval or a
    summary was blocked by sensitivity, and the user saying yes.

Both call request_confidential_access() below — there is exactly one
implementation of "who may request, when it's a duplicate, what gets
audited". The router maps AccessRequestError.status_code onto an
HTTPException; the tool relays AccessRequestError.message as a plain string.

This is the request side of the "contributor with an active access grant"
exception in app/services/access_control.py: a viewer/contributor blocked
from confidential content asks the team's lead for clearance; once approved
they get a 90-day grant that can_view_document() honours.
