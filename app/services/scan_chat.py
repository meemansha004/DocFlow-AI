"""
One turn of the /scan conversation, shared by the CLI (cli.py) and the HTTP
endpoint (app/routers/agents.py).

This is the standalone Structure Scanner chat — DEFERRED_ITEMS.md #4's
"paste/select content and score it independently" capability. It is a thin
wrapper over the existing Scanner Agent (app/agents/scanner_agent.py) and its
three tools (score_document / reform_document / scan_for_injection): no new
scanning logic, no persistence, no ABAC.

Fully decoupled from persistence, exactly like draft_chat:
  - no DB, no chat_sessions/chat_messages, no stage/team/project,
  - multi-turn context ("now reform it") works only within a process, via the
    Agno agent's own in-context history keyed by the namespaced session id.

The agno session id is `scan-<caller uuid>` — namespaced so it can never
collide with a drafting/rag session that happens to reuse the same uuid.
