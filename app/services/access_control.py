"""
Core ABAC/RBAC permission functions.

has_permission() — the RBAC-style rank comparison, cumulative hierarchy,
with org_admin/project_admin full bypass and the contributor confidential-
access-grant exception.

classify_document_visibility() — the full ABAC decision for a specific
document (bypass, team visibility, sensitivity clearance), as a three-way
outcome. can_view_document() is a bool-collapsing wrapper over it — the
finer-grained outcome exists because Phase C retrieval needs to know WHY a
document was excluded (not visible at all, vs. visible but sensitivity-
blocked) to later offer a "request access" suggestion; nothing about the
underlying logic changed by adding it.

build_access_filter() — compound filter for listing/searching documents.

has_any_project_access() — the coarse "does this user have ANY relationship
to this project at all" gate (any team membership, or project/org admin),
used to hard-reject a total stranger before any further, more expensive
work (e.g. a Qdrant call in retrieval.py).
