"""
One turn of the /rag conversation, shared by the CLI (cli.py) and the HTTP
endpoint (app/routers/agents.py).

Responsibilities:

  1. SCOPING — resolve the ChatSession for this turn via
     app/services/chat_history. A conversation belongs to exactly one
     (user_id, project_id); a caller can't continue someone else's session,
     and the same user's Project A conversation can't bleed into Project B.

  2. CONTEXT — the RAG tools need the caller's real user_id/project_id, but
     that must never be an LLM-supplied argument. Set on
     app/services/rag_context around the run, reset always.

  3. HISTORY — Agno keeps its own in-context history keyed by the canonical
     session id (and user_id) in `ai.agent_sessions_runs`; we ALSO mirror
     every user/assistant turn into our own `chat_messages` so the
     conversation is queryable through first-party models and survives
     independently of Agno's schema.

The agno session id is `rag-<canonical uuid>` — namespaced so it can never
collide with a drafting/scanner session that happens to reuse the same uuid.
