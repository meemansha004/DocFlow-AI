Structure Scanner — rubric definition and scoring prompt (Phase 3).

The rubric is UNIVERSAL — it does not check a document against any specific
required_documents checklist item (that link is used only for gap-detection/
coverage in Phase 5, not for scan quality). Every document, regardless of
type, is scored against the same 3 structural-quality criteria.

Threshold is PERCENTAGE-BASED (60% of max possible score) so it auto-scales
if the criteria list changes again — no manual recalculation needed.

SYSTEM_PROMPT = f"""You are a document structure quality scanner for a project management system. Your job is to evaluate ONE uploaded document against 3 universal structural-quality criteria and return a numeric score for each.

You are NOT checking whether the document is the "right" document for its project stage, and you are NOT checking factual accuracy. You are ONLY checking structural/formatting quality: is this document well-organized, complete, and accurately labeled.

RUBRIC (score each 0-20, integers only):

1. structural_clarity — clear headings/sections, logical flow vs. undifferentiated text
2. completeness — no blank fields, placeholders, or screenshot-dumps standing in for real content
3. labeling_accuracy — section content actually matches its heading

For each criterion, give a brief one-sentence note explaining the score — cite something specific from the document, not a generic statement.

Also provide a "summary" field: ONE short sentence (max ~25 words) identifying which criterion/criteria pulled the overall score down the most and why, in plain human language a reviewer can read at a glance. If the document scored well overall (no criterion below 15), the summary should say so briefly instead (e.g. "No significant issues; document is well-structured throughout.").

Respond with ONLY valid JSON, no preamble, no markdown code fences, in exactly this shape:

{{
  "criteria": [
    {{"name": "structural_clarity", "score": <int 0-20>, "note": "<one sentence>"}},
    {{"name": "completeness", "score": <int 0-20>, "note": "<one sentence>"}},

  "summary": "<one short sentence, plain language, what pulled the score down or that it's fine>"

# Requirements Specification - Order Management Module

## 1. Overview
This document defines functional and non-functional requirements for the Order Management module, covering order creation, status tracking, and cancellation workflows.

## 2. Functional Requirements
### 2.1 Order Creation
The system shall allow authenticated users to create new orders by selecting items from the catalog, specifying quantities, and confirming a shipping address. Upon submission, the system shall generate a unique order ID and set status to "Pending".

### 2.2 Status Tracking
Orders shall progress through the following statuses: Pending -> Confirmed -> Shipped -> Delivered. Each transition shall be timestamped and logged.

### 2.3 Cancellation
Users may cancel an order while status is "Pending" or "Confirmed". Cancellation after "Shipped" requires a return request instead.

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements
- Order creation must complete within 2 seconds under normal load.
- All order data must be encrypted at rest.

## 4. Stakeholder Sign-off
Approved by: Priya Sharma, Product Lead — 2026-03-12""",
