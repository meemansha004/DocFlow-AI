"""
On-disk working copy of the in-progress chat draft.

The draft being edited in a /draft conversation lives in a session-scoped
working file — drafts/.wip/<session_id>.md — rewritten on every revision. That
file, NOT any in-memory variable, is the source of truth for "the current
draft": it is inspectable mid-conversation, and it is the exact bytes that get
scanned and saved when the user finalizes. The LLM never carries draft content
through a tool argument.

Concurrency: every function takes `session_id` EXPLICITLY. There is no
module-level "current session" — the CLI has one session, the HTTP server has
one per request, and two of them touching this module at the same time must
never see each other's working file.

Still fully decoupled from persistence (MERGE_DECISIONS §4): no DB, no ABAC,
no stage / team / project.
