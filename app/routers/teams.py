"""
Team management within a project — creating the teams THEMSELVES (not assigning
users to them; that's /admin/assign-roles). Until now teams only ever existed
via the one seeded on project creation, or raw SQL — same gap stages had.

  GET  /projects/{project_id}/teams   list this project's teams (+ member counts)
  POST /projects/{project_id}/teams   create a team                (project_admin+)

"project_admin+" = org_admin (tenant-wide) or a ProjectAdmin scope on this
project — the same gate as stage creation. A newly created team shows up
immediately in GET /workspace (which lists every team of a project for its
admins), so the "Assign Roles" modal's team dropdown picks it up with no extra
wiring.
